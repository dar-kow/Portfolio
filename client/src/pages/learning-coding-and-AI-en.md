# Is it Worth Slaving Over Code in the AI Era, or Programmer vs. Machine

Do you remember all those sleepless nights over code? Hours spent on Stack Overflow, desperately looking for answers to a bug that turned your project upside down? Or maybe those moments of enlightenment after your third coffee, when you finally find a typo in a variable? Well, welcome to the world of traditional programming! But wait... It's 2024, and artificial intelligence is knocking on our IDEs with the promise of ending all these frustrations. Does this mean we can put documentation on the shelf and let AI take the wheel?

## Old School, or How Steel Was Tempered

Let's start with what learning programming looked like "in the old days" (read: just a few years ago). Imagine a young adept of the programming art, who excitedly opens their first documentation. In front of them are hundreds of pages of technical jargon, and each line of code is like a hieroglyph requiring decryption. It was a world where Google and Stack Overflow were a programmer's best friends, and every problem solution resembled a detective investigation.

The traditional learning method has something of military training - it's difficult, sometimes painful, but it builds character. You spend hours analyzing code, debugging an application line by line, and each success tastes like a personal victory. It's in these moments of frustration that real problem-solving skills are born.

### The Charms of the "Old School"

Programming by the traditional method is like learning to ride a bicycle without training wheels. The beginnings are difficult and painful, but once you catch your balance, no hill is scary for you. Every error in the code is a lesson, every application crash is an opportunity to learn. I remember once spending three days looking for a bug in the code, only to discover that I had forgotten a semicolon. But do I regret that time? Absolutely not! It's exactly these experiences that teach humility and precision.

## New Era: AI Enters the Game

And now let's move to the present, where AI is like that smarter classmate who always has a solution at hand. GitHub Copilot suggests code before you have time to think about what you need. Claude and ChatGPT are ready to explain the most intricate programming concepts to you, and various AI tools practically write code for you.

Sounds like a programming utopia, right? Well, not so fast...

### The Bittersweet Taste of AI

Imagine the situation: you're working on a new project, and your AI friend generates code faster than you can read it. Everything works perfectly until... it doesn't. And then the real fun begins. Because how do you debug code that you don't fully understand? It's a bit like trying to repair a car when all you know how to do is press the gas and brake.

AI can be like an overprotective parent - it solves all your problems, but is it really doing you a favor? Sure, code is created instantly, but do you really understand what's happening "under the hood"?

## Real Stories from the Front

Meet Mark, a junior who decided to learn programming exclusively with AI help. Initially, everything went smoothly - projects were created quickly, and the code looked professional. The problem appeared during his first job interview when a question about the basics of asynchronicity in JavaScript came up. AI couldn't prompt him, and Mark... well, let's just say he didn't get that job.

On the other hand, we have Anna, a senior developer with 10 years of experience, who treats AI as her assistant. She uses it to automate tedious tasks, generate tests and documentation, but always carefully verifies each line of code. As she says herself: "AI is a great tool, but you need to know when and how to use it."

## The Golden Mean, or How Not to Get Lost in the AI World

The truth is that we don't have to choose between being a programming purist and complete dependence on AI. The best approach is... common sense! Think of AI as a very intelligent assistant. It's great that it helps you in your work, but you should make the final decisions yourself.

### Recipe for Success in the AI Era

Start with solid foundations - yes, this means some "slaving over code" and reading documentation. It's like learning the alphabet before trying to write a novel. Once you understand the basics, AI becomes your ally, not a ball and chain.

Use AI wisely - let it generate code for you, but always analyze it. Treat it like checking homework - trust, but verify. Remember that AI is a tool, not a magic wand solving all problems.

## What Will the Future Bring?

Will traditional programming be like knowledge of Latin in 10 years - respected but impractical? I seriously doubt it. Paradoxically, with the development of AI, a fundamental understanding of programming becomes even more important. Because who will verify and optimize the code generated by AI? Who will design the architecture of systems? Who will make key technological decisions?

### Epilogue: Programmer 2.0

The programmer of the future is someone who can combine the "old school" with new technologies. It's a person who understands the fundamentals but isn't afraid to use modern tools. It's someone who knows when it's worth spending an hour debugging and when to ask AI for help.

So is it worth learning programming by traditional methods in the AI era? The answer is: absolutely yes! But with wise use of new tools. Because in the end, it's not about being a purist or a technological revolutionary, but about being an effective programmer.

And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to debugging code... which this time was generated by AI. Life can be ironic, can't it?
